# Neural Network

## Notes 06

1. ANN is similar to HumanBrain : signal node, weight of signal, activationFunction
2. layers, FeatureGenerationk
   - shallow learning : ex)regression, NaiveBayes -> limit to feature selection
   - deep learning : machines can do featureSelection
   - layers in NN : layers have each feature selection method(detect line, shade)
     - back propogation(giving feedback from the sesult layer), num: gradient descent
3. disadvantage of NN
   - blackbox style, cost: data&compute
   - ML model Library : tensorflow Hub, Model Zoo
4. DEMO


## Notes 07
